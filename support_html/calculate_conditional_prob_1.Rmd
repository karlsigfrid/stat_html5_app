In this task, we need to calculate a conditional probability.

In the example that we use, we know the following:

$P(A)=0.7$

$P(B)=0.3$

$P(Y|A)=0.2$

$P(Y|B)=0.8$

$P(Y, A) = 0.14$

$P(Y, B) = 0.24$

$P(Y)=0.38$

We want to calculate $P(A|Y)$

You may recall that the joint probabilities were calculated with the formula

$P(Y, A) = P(Y|A) \cdot P(A)$

If we divide both sides of the equation with $P(A)$, we get

$\cfrac{P(Y, A)}{P(A)} = P(Y|A)$

So we can calculate a conditional probability by dividing a joint probability with a marginal probability. If we divide $P(Y, A)$ by $P(Y)$ instead of $P(A)$, we get

$\cfrac{P(Y, A)}{P(Y)} = P(A|Y)$,

and that is what we want. With this formula we can calculate 

$P(A|Y) = \cfrac{P(Y, A)}{P(Y)} = \cfrac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368$

One more thing. Since we know that $P(Y, A) = P(Y|A) \cdot P(A)$, we can write

$P(A|Y) = \cfrac{P(Y|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(Y)}$

This is known as **Bayes theorem**.
