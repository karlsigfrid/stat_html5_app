Say that an event $Y$ *can only* happen together with event $A$ or together with event $B$ or together with event $C$.

In other words, $Y$ can happen through three possible **joint events** $(Y, A)$, $(Y, B)$, $(Y, C)$.

It is then the case that

$P(Y) = P(Y, A) + P(Y, B) + P(Y, C)$

This is an example of the **law of total probability**, which states that the probability of an event occurring is the sum the probabilities of all the different ways in which it can occur.

Example:

$Y$ is the event that a player 1 wins a 5-set tennis match, $(Y, A)$ is the event that that player 1 wins in 3 straight sets, $(Y, B)$ is the event that player 1 wins after 4 sets, and $(Y, C)$ is the event that player 1 wins after 5 sets.

In this example you can see that $P(Y) = P(Y, A) + P(Y, B) + P(Y, C)$ is true, since there is no way of winning a match other than winning after either 3, 4 or 5 sets.
