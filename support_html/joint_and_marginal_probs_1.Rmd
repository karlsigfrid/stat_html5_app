## Sheep and horses in formal notation

We are interested in whether animals on a farm like apples. The animals at the farm are sheep and horses.

70 percent of the animals on the farm are sheep, and 30 percent are horses. So if we pick one random animal, and each animal has the same chance of being picked, the probability of picking a sheep is 0.7 and the probability of picking a horse is 0.3.

To write this in a more formal way, say that the event of randomly picking a sheep is A, and the event of randomly picking a horse is B. Then

$P(A)=0.7$

$P(B)=0.3$.

$P(A)$ is the *marginal probability* of picking a sheep, meaning that if you have no information about the animal that you pick randomly (such as whether it likes apples), this is the probability that you pick it.  

Here comes some more information about the farm animals: 20 percent of the sheep like apples, and 80 percent of the horses like apples.

Another way to express the same information is this: Given that the randomly selected animal is a sheep, the probability that it likes apples is 0.2. Given that the animal is a horse, the probability that it likes apples is 0.8.

These are called *conditional probabilities*. To write this in formal notation, we let $Y$ be the event that an animal likes apples.

$P(Y|A)=0.2$

$P(Y|B)=0.8$

You can read the vertical line $|$ as "given", so $P(Y|A)=0.2$ reads "The probability of $Y$ given $A$ is 0.2". And in this context it means "The probability that a randomly chosen animal at the farm likes apples (Y) is 0.2 given that the animal is a sheep (A)".
